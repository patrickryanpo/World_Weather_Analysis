# World_Weather_Analysis

# Project Overview
This project uses APIs to visualize weather data in order to provide travellers with the necessary data that will aid in planning. Random longitude and latitude coordinates were generated, which was then associated with corresponding city names using the citipy module. 

## Vacation Search
The vacation search project allows for users to input their preferred maximum and minimum temperatures and generates a list of preferred vacation destinations.

## Vacation Itinerary
The vacation itinerary project maps out user selected cities onto a Google directions API. The use of the API allows for the user to visualize their route based on the four destinations chosen.
